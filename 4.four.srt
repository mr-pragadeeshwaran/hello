1

00:00:01,170  -->  00:00:05,340
<v Jonas>So the DOM actually also includes CSS Styles.</v>
2

2

00:00:05,340  -->  00:00:09,860
And so with DOM manipulation, we can also change Styles.
3

3

00:00:09,860  -->  00:00:11,653
So let's try that out now.
4

4

00:00:13,130  -->  00:00:16,630
And what I want to do here is to change the background
5

5

00:00:16,630  -->  00:00:19,910
of this entire page here to a green color.
6

6

00:00:19,910  -->  00:00:22,830
Whenever the player guesses the right number,
7

7

00:00:22,830  -->  00:00:25,360
so when the player wins the game.
8

8

00:00:25,360  -->  00:00:29,083
And we will also make this number here, wider then.
9

9

00:00:30,190  -->  00:00:32,040
So let me just demonstrate that here.
10

10

00:00:34,100  -->  00:00:36,283
So let's quickly win this game here.
11

11

00:00:38,440  -->  00:00:40,190
Seventeen.
12

12

00:00:40,190  -->  00:00:41,520
And so you see,
13

13

00:00:41,520  -->  00:00:43,490
we want this green background,
14

14

00:00:43,490  -->  00:00:46,780
and also this number here being wider.
15

15

00:00:46,780  -->  00:00:50,230
And for that, of course, we need to manipulate the Styles
16

16

00:00:50,230  -->  00:00:51,440
of this page.
17

17

00:00:51,440  -->  00:00:52,663
So the CSS.
18

18

00:00:55,050  -->  00:00:58,170
Okay, so that should happen here in this scenario,
19

19

00:00:58,170  -->  00:01:00,140
where the player wins the game.
20

20

00:01:00,140  -->  00:01:03,130
So where the guess is equal to the secret number
21

21

00:01:03,130  -->  00:01:05,510
and actually, let's add some comments here
22

22

00:01:05,510  -->  00:01:08,870
to make this code a little bit easier to understand.
23

23

00:01:08,870  -->  00:01:10,140
So this one,
24

24

00:01:10,140  -->  00:01:10,973
when
25

25

00:01:12,060  -->  00:01:13,133
player wins,
26

26

00:01:14,570  -->  00:01:15,710
this first one is
27

27

00:01:16,710  -->  00:01:18,440
when there is no
28

28

00:01:19,470  -->  00:01:20,303
input.
29

29

00:01:23,860  -->  00:01:25,240
This is when
30

30

00:01:25,240  -->  00:01:27,130
guess is
31

31

00:01:27,130  -->  00:01:28,130
too high.
32

32

00:01:33,116  -->  00:01:34,616
And this one here,
33

33

00:01:35,639  -->  00:01:37,200
this one guess is too
34

34

00:01:38,820  -->  00:01:39,653
low.
35

35

00:01:40,960  -->  00:01:44,990
So this now at least looks a little bit nicer.
36

36

00:01:44,990  -->  00:01:49,710
But anyway, let's now learn how to manipulate CSS Styles.
37

37

00:01:49,710  -->  00:01:53,500
So we want to manipulate the Style of this whole page.
38

38

00:01:53,500  -->  00:01:54,840
And so what we need to do
39

39

00:01:54,840  -->  00:01:57,963
is to select the whole body of this page first.
40

40

00:01:59,540  -->  00:02:03,490
Okay, so the body is basically this entire visible part
41

41

00:02:03,490  -->  00:02:04,563
of the website.
42

42

00:02:06,320  -->  00:02:09,083
So it's basically this whole element.
43

43

00:02:10,110  -->  00:02:11,600
Alright.
44

44

00:02:11,600  -->  00:02:15,060
So as always, we need to start by selecting the element
45

45

00:02:15,060  -->  00:02:16,543
that we want to manipulate.
46

46

00:02:17,550  -->  00:02:18,383
So
47

47

00:02:18,383  -->  00:02:20,283
Document Dot querySelector,
48

48

00:02:22,000  -->  00:02:23,460
and then the selector.
49

49

00:02:23,460  -->  00:02:26,800
And now it's just the body element so there's no Dot
50

50

00:02:26,800  -->  00:02:28,710
because that's for classes.
51

51

00:02:28,710  -->  00:02:31,860
It's just really the element name.
52

52

00:02:31,860  -->  00:02:33,580
And since there's only one body,
53

53

00:02:33,580  -->  00:02:35,690
it's going to work just fine.
54

54

00:02:35,690  -->  00:02:37,430
So here, we select the body.
55

55

00:02:37,430  -->  00:02:40,060
And now we want to change the CSS Style.
56

56

00:02:40,060  -->  00:02:43,500
So here, we need to write Style.
57

57

00:02:43,500  -->  00:02:44,980
So we access basically,
58

58

00:02:44,980  -->  00:02:47,950
the Style property of this element and then
59

59

00:02:47,950  -->  00:02:49,260
another Dot
60

60

00:02:49,260  -->  00:02:52,470
and then the name of the property that we want to change.
61

61

00:02:52,470  -->  00:02:55,043
And in this case, it is the background color.
62

62

00:02:56,290  -->  00:02:57,990
So background
63

63

00:02:57,990  -->  00:03:01,470
and in CSS, we write the background color like this
64

64

00:03:01,470  -->  00:03:03,370
background Dash
65

65

00:03:03,370  -->  00:03:04,290
color,
66

66

00:03:04,290  -->  00:03:05,220
right.
67

67

00:03:05,220  -->  00:03:07,930
However, in JavaScript that's not allowed.
68

68

00:03:07,930  -->  00:03:09,210
And so in JavaScript
69

69

00:03:09,210  -->  00:03:12,110
all these property names that have two words
70

70

00:03:12,110  -->  00:03:13,880
like background color
71

71

00:03:13,880  -->  00:03:16,620
will simply adopt the Camel case notation
72

72

00:03:16,620  -->  00:03:18,537
that I already explained you before,
73

73

00:03:18,537  -->  00:03:20,840
and that we've been using all the time.
74

74

00:03:20,840  -->  00:03:22,770
So instead of background Dash color
75

75

00:03:22,770  -->  00:03:24,930
it's going to be background
76

76

00:03:24,930  -->  00:03:26,340
uppercase C
77

77

00:03:26,340  -->  00:03:28,380
for color like this.
78

78

00:03:28,380  -->  00:03:31,530
And the same rule applies to all the other property names
79

79

00:03:31,530  -->  00:03:33,440
that have multiple words.
80

80

00:03:33,440  -->  00:03:35,770
So Style Dot background color,
81

81

00:03:35,770  -->  00:03:37,890
and now we set it to something.
82

82

00:03:37,890  -->  00:03:39,890
And let's get the actual color
83

83

00:03:39,890  -->  00:03:41,380
from or
84

84

00:03:41,380  -->  00:03:42,393
CSS.
85

85

00:03:43,900  -->  00:03:46,340
So you see that background color,
86

86

00:03:46,340  -->  00:03:48,920
here is the one that we're trying to define.
87

87

00:03:48,920  -->  00:03:52,480
And we will specify it to this color value.
88

88

00:03:52,480  -->  00:03:57,430
So this is a standard RBG value in hexadecimal.
89

89

00:03:57,430  -->  00:04:02,430
And so we set it equal to 10, we must write a string,
90

90

00:04:02,520  -->  00:04:05,320
and then the value we want to set it to.
91

91

00:04:05,320  -->  00:04:08,940
So just like before, to set anything on the DOM,
92

92

00:04:08,940  -->  00:04:11,280
we simply use the Equal sign.
93

93

00:04:11,280  -->  00:04:13,270
So we have all of this.
94

94

00:04:13,270  -->  00:04:16,830
So the background color property on the Style property,
95

95

00:04:16,830  -->  00:04:19,800
and we want to set it to this value,
96

96

00:04:19,800  -->  00:04:23,030
and so we set it equal to the value.
97

97

00:04:23,030  -->  00:04:23,950
Okay,
98

98

00:04:23,950  -->  00:04:25,410
so that's one part.
99

99

00:04:25,410  -->  00:04:28,480
And now let's also increase the width
100

100

00:04:28,480  -->  00:04:30,470
of this number here.
101

101

00:04:30,470  -->  00:04:31,400
Okay,
102

102

00:04:31,400  -->  00:04:35,070
that's important because I want to show you something there.
103

103

00:04:35,070  -->  00:04:37,483
So Document Dot querySelector.
104

104

00:04:39,320  -->  00:04:42,703
And that is the element with the class of number.
105

105

00:04:44,890  -->  00:04:45,840
And again,
106

106

00:04:45,840  -->  00:04:47,480
we want to change the Style.
107

107

00:04:47,480  -->  00:04:49,440
So Dot Style,
108

108

00:04:49,440  -->  00:04:50,273
Dot
109

109

00:04:50,273  -->  00:04:51,106
width,
110

110

00:04:51,960  -->  00:04:55,090
and then again we need to specify a string.
111

111

00:04:55,090  -->  00:04:57,680
So whenever we are manipulating a Style,
112

112

00:04:57,680  -->  00:05:00,670
we always need to specify a string .
113

113

00:05:00,670  -->  00:05:03,980
We cannot just write like a number like 30,
114

114

00:05:03,980  -->  00:05:05,460
it has to be a string.
115

115

00:05:05,460  -->  00:05:07,920
In India, we need a unit.
116

116

00:05:07,920  -->  00:05:12,920
And now I already closed the file so let's open it up again.
117

117

00:05:12,950  -->  00:05:15,450
And the number that I'm looking for
118

118

00:05:15,450  -->  00:05:17,310
currently has a width
119

119

00:05:17,310  -->  00:05:18,143
of 15
120

120

00:05:18,143  -->  00:05:19,430
REM.
121

121

00:05:19,430  -->  00:05:22,143
And now I want to double it. So 30 REM,
122

122

00:05:23,510  -->  00:05:24,850
so
123

123

00:05:24,850  -->  00:05:25,830
30.
124

124

00:05:25,830  -->  00:05:27,050
REM,
125

125

00:05:27,050  -->  00:05:30,270
and again it needs to be inside of a string.
126

126

00:05:30,270  -->  00:05:32,500
I cannot just write 30 REM,
127

127

00:05:32,500  -->  00:05:34,840
or 30. So just a number,
128

128

00:05:34,840  -->  00:05:36,110
that would not work,
129

129

00:05:36,110  -->  00:05:38,060
we have to specify a string,
130

130

00:05:38,060  -->  00:05:41,310
which in this case contains the number
131

131

00:05:41,310  -->  00:05:42,143
plus
132

132

00:05:42,143  -->  00:05:43,550
the unit.
133

133

00:05:43,550  -->  00:05:47,120
So the same would be for percentages or pixels,
134

134

00:05:47,120  -->  00:05:50,400
or whatever unit we used in CSS.
135

135

00:05:50,400  -->  00:05:52,280
Okay, give it a safe now.
136

136

00:05:52,280  -->  00:05:55,930
And now let's actually try the correct number right away.
137

137

00:05:55,930  -->  00:05:57,550
So 12.
138

138

00:05:57,550  -->  00:05:58,383
And
139

139

00:05:58,383  -->  00:05:59,216
yes,
140

140

00:05:59,216  -->  00:06:00,330
it worked.
141

141

00:06:00,330  -->  00:06:03,030
Let's actually get rid of the console here,
142

142

00:06:03,030  -->  00:06:05,120
then the page looks a bit nicer.
143

143

00:06:05,120  -->  00:06:06,570
And we can also by the way
144

144

00:06:06,570  -->  00:06:08,900
get rid of the terminal here
145

145

00:06:08,900  -->  00:06:10,700
in VS code
146

146

00:06:10,700  -->  00:06:13,570
because even if we close this panel here,
147

147

00:06:13,570  -->  00:06:15,920
this process will still keep running,
148

148

00:06:15,920  -->  00:06:18,480
the only way we stop this process from running
149

149

00:06:18,480  -->  00:06:21,550
is by hitting here this trash can,
150

150

00:06:21,550  -->  00:06:26,020
which will kill the terminal or by hitting Ctrl C.
151

151

00:06:26,020  -->  00:06:29,820
So let's close it because this takes up too much space.
152

152

00:06:29,820  -->  00:06:33,040
But now Yeah, so this worked just fine.
153

153

00:06:33,040  -->  00:06:37,070
Now these Styles are actually set as Inline Styles.
154

154

00:06:37,070  -->  00:06:38,830
So of course, we are not changing
155

155

00:06:38,830  -->  00:06:41,780
the CSS file or anything like that.
156

156

00:06:41,780  -->  00:06:43,750
And let me just show that to you.
157

157

00:06:43,750  -->  00:06:47,503
So actually, I will need back the Dev tools here.
158

158

00:06:48,620  -->  00:06:51,653
Make it a bit larger now just to show it to you.
159

159

00:06:52,610  -->  00:06:53,520
And
160

160

00:06:55,580  -->  00:06:57,880
so Indeed, it is an Inline Style.
161

161

00:06:57,880  -->  00:07:00,760
So a Style that is applied directly in
162

162

00:07:00,760  -->  00:07:03,570
the HTML using the Style attribute.
163

163

00:07:03,570  -->  00:07:06,770
And the same is going to be true for the body.
164

164

00:07:06,770  -->  00:07:07,980
Exactly.
165

165

00:07:07,980  -->  00:07:10,783
So we see here, this is the background color
166

166

00:07:10,783  -->  00:07:12,293
that we just applied.
167

167

00:07:13,540  -->  00:07:14,373
Alright.
168

168

00:07:17,170  -->  00:07:19,520
So of course not changing the CSS file
169

169

00:07:19,520  -->  00:07:21,540
or anything like that.
170

170

00:07:21,540  -->  00:07:22,610
Okay.
171

171

00:07:22,610  -->  00:07:23,800
And that's it actually,
172

172

00:07:23,800  -->  00:07:27,280
that's really the fundamentals of manipulating Styles
173

173

00:07:27,280  -->  00:07:28,710
in CSS
174

174

00:07:28,710  -->  00:07:30,380
The most important thing to remember
175

175

00:07:30,380  -->  00:07:33,170
is to use the Style property.
176

176

00:07:33,170  -->  00:07:36,810
And then on there is where we specify the CSS property.
177

177

00:07:36,810  -->  00:07:39,160
And we need to specify that property
178

178

00:07:39,160  -->  00:07:43,150
in the Camel case notation in case there is two words
179

179

00:07:43,150  -->  00:07:45,573
and then the value always needs to be a string.
180

180

00:07:46,510  -->  00:07:49,760
So that's all you need to know in order to change Styles
181

181

00:07:49,760  -->  00:07:51,710
like we just did here.
182

182

00:07:51,710  -->  00:07:52,700
Awesome.
183

183

00:07:52,700  -->  00:07:55,930
We're doing great progress in this project.
184

184

00:07:55,930  -->  00:07:58,430
And I hope that you're enjoying it so far.
185

185

00:07:58,430  -->  00:08:00,600
And that you find it a lot of fun
186

186

00:08:00,600  -->  00:08:04,760
to be able to manipulate a webpage like this.
187

187

00:08:04,760  -->  00:08:06,430
Anyway, in the next video,
188

188

00:08:06,430  -->  00:08:10,760
we will implement this reset button here basically
189

189

00:08:10,760  -->  00:08:13,210
where we can play the game again.
190

190

00:08:13,210  -->  00:08:15,303
And so I hope to see you there soon.
