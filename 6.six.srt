00:00:01,360  -->  00:00:03,520
<v Jonas>Now that we have a better understanding</v>
2

2

00:00:03,520  -->  00:00:07,090
of what DOM and DOM manipulation are,
3

3

00:00:07,090  -->  00:00:11,423
lets now actually select and manipulate some more elements.
4

4

00:00:12,850  -->  00:00:14,370
So in the previous lecture,
5

5

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:17,810
we already selected this message element here,
6

6

00:00:17,810  -->  00:00:20,780
by using querSelector, right?
7

7

00:00:20,780  -->  00:00:25,600
Then we also got the text content from the selected element.
8

8

00:00:25,600  -->  00:00:28,320
But besides getting the text content,
9

9

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:32,190
we can also set the content of the element.
10

10

00:00:32,190  -->  00:00:33,870
So let do that.
11

11

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:35,740
So instead of start guessing,
12

12

00:00:35,740  -->  00:00:38,690
lets say like correct number.
13

13

00:00:38,690  -->  00:00:41,303
So that's actually gonna be like the winning phrase.
14

14

00:00:42,200  -->  00:00:44,053
So again we select the element,
15

15

00:00:45,690  -->  00:00:46,540
so querySelector,
16

16

00:00:50,804  -->  00:00:52,750
and the same selector so again,
17

17

00:00:52,750  -->  00:00:54,953
the element with the class of message,
18

18

00:00:55,860  -->  00:00:59,630
and then again text content.
19

19

00:00:59,630  -->  00:01:03,210
So that's exactly the same as here, okay.
20

20

00:01:03,210  -->  00:01:05,920
Now here we actually then logged the result
21

21

00:01:05,920  -->  00:01:08,550
to the console so that we could see it.
22

22

00:01:08,550  -->  00:01:09,383
But here,
23

23

00:01:09,383  -->  00:01:12,930
we will actually set this content to something else.
24

24

00:01:12,930  -->  00:01:15,053
And we do that by writing equal,
25

25

00:01:15,950  -->  00:01:18,703
and then whatever we want the new content to be.
26

26

00:01:20,020  -->  00:01:23,083
So lets say, correct number,
27

27

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:26,873
and I'm also gonna add here the party emoji,
28

28

00:01:28,360  -->  00:01:30,173
but again you don't need to do that.
29

29

00:01:31,200  -->  00:01:34,510
It's just to improve the design of the app a little bit
30

30

00:01:34,510  -->  00:01:35,700
basically.
31

31

00:01:35,700  -->  00:01:37,130
And so now if I save this,
32

32

00:01:37,130  -->  00:01:40,640
it should immediately change this text content here.
33

33

00:01:40,640  -->  00:01:42,293
So watch as I save now,
34

34

00:01:43,640  -->  00:01:45,430
and nothing happened,
35

35

00:01:45,430  -->  00:01:48,150
but that's because I'm here on the demo version.
36

36

00:01:48,150  -->  00:01:49,860
So I need the real one,
37

37

00:01:49,860  -->  00:01:53,030
and so here you see now correct number.
38

38

00:01:53,030  -->  00:01:55,220
Great, so that worked.
39

39

00:01:55,220  -->  00:01:57,700
And down here we still have to start guessing,
40

40

00:01:57,700  -->  00:02:00,210
because that's what the content of the element
41

41

00:02:00,210  -->  00:02:01,403
used to be before.
42

42

00:02:03,360  -->  00:02:05,980
So in this line we started by reading the content
43

43

00:02:05,980  -->  00:02:07,160
of the element,
44

44

00:02:07,160  -->  00:02:10,660
and so at the beginning it will still start guessing.
45

45

00:02:10,660  -->  00:02:14,500
Because that's what's written here in the HTML element,
46

46

00:02:14,500  -->  00:02:16,710
in the beginning, right?
47

47

00:02:16,710  -->  00:02:18,920
Then in the next line we changed it,
48

48

00:02:18,920  -->  00:02:21,690
and now if we would attempt to read it again,
49

49

00:02:21,690  -->  00:02:25,090
it should then be this new content that we set before.
50

50

00:02:25,090  -->  00:02:28,610
So lets copy and paste this line here really quick.
51

51

00:02:28,610  -->  00:02:29,600
Give it a save,
52

52

00:02:29,600  -->  00:02:32,090
and so now you see that of course
53

53

00:02:32,090  -->  00:02:35,860
after changing the text content when we then read it,
54

54

00:02:35,860  -->  00:02:37,910
it will be this new content,
55

55

00:02:37,910  -->  00:02:39,673
so exactly what we have now here.
56

56

00:02:41,820  -->  00:02:44,170
Okay, that makes sense?
57

57

00:02:44,170  -->  00:02:48,880
And so what we did here is really already DOM manipulation.
58

58

00:02:48,880  -->  00:02:52,590
Because in fact, here we manipulated the text content
59

59

00:02:52,590  -->  00:02:54,460
of one of the DOM notes.
60

60

00:02:54,460  -->  00:02:56,373
So essentially this element here.
61

61

00:02:58,160  -->  00:03:02,320
So lets now do the same with this secret number,
62

62

00:03:02,320  -->  00:03:03,890
and also the score.
63

63

00:03:03,890  -->  00:03:06,080
So both of these values,
64

64

00:03:06,080  -->  00:03:08,680
are basically stored in an element.
65

65

00:03:08,680  -->  00:03:12,130
So lets take a look at the HTML and so,
66

66

00:03:12,130  -->  00:03:14,230
this is what I was telling you in the beginning,
67

67

00:03:14,230  -->  00:03:16,280
that we would need this HTML
68

68

00:03:16,280  -->  00:03:19,320
to basically get the class names of all the elements
69

69

00:03:19,320  -->  00:03:21,260
that we are interested in.
70

70

00:03:21,260  -->  00:03:23,620
So this secret number here,
71

71

00:03:23,620  -->  00:03:25,220
so this here,
72

72

00:03:25,220  -->  00:03:29,930
is basically this div element here with the class number.
73

73

00:03:29,930  -->  00:03:32,030
And then the score as you see down here,
74

74

00:03:32,030  -->  00:03:33,023
from this 20,
75

75

00:03:33,940  -->  00:03:35,780
this is where it's 20 is,
76

76

00:03:35,780  -->  00:03:36,730
and in this case,
77

77

00:03:36,730  -->  00:03:40,730
it is this span element with the class score.
78

78

00:03:40,730  -->  00:03:41,840
So now lets go ahead
79

79

00:03:41,840  -->  00:03:46,253
and select the elements with the class number and score.
80

80

00:03:49,210  -->  00:03:52,800
Okay, so that's exactly what we did before,
81

81

00:03:52,800  -->  00:03:54,290
so querySelector,
82

82

00:03:55,770  -->  00:03:57,423
with the class number.
83

83

00:03:58,810  -->  00:04:01,370
And just to experiment some more with this,
84

84

00:04:01,370  -->  00:04:04,973
lets actually set it to something, lets say 13.
85

85

00:04:05,930  -->  00:04:10,930
And then document dot querySelector dot score.
86

86

00:04:14,630  -->  00:04:18,090
And by the way, there also other ways of selecting elements
87

87

00:04:18,090  -->  00:04:20,890
but we will talk about them in one of the next projects.
88

88

00:04:22,340  -->  00:04:26,680
And lets set this element also to another value.
89

89

00:04:26,680  -->  00:04:30,040
Now I'm actually, I'm forgetting the text content here,
90

90

00:04:30,040  -->  00:04:32,500
so we cannot set the entire element,
91

91

00:04:32,500  -->  00:04:36,173
because the element has way more than just the content.
92

92

00:04:37,460  -->  00:04:41,623
So I really have to say that the text content should be 13.
93

93

00:04:43,170  -->  00:04:44,920
So text content,
94

94

00:04:44,920  -->  00:04:46,810
and now as I re-log this,
95

95

00:04:46,810  -->  00:04:49,640
this should be 13 and this 20.
96

96

00:04:49,640  -->  00:04:52,850
Lets actually set this to another number,
97

97

00:04:52,850  -->  00:04:54,750
otherwise we wouldn't see it changing.
98

98

00:04:55,870  -->  00:04:59,850
And indeed we get 13 and ten now,
99

99

00:04:59,850  -->  00:05:02,150
great, that's amazing.
100

100

00:05:02,150  -->  00:05:05,040
So doing some great DOM manipulation here.
101

101

00:05:05,040  -->  00:05:07,170
And now lets move on and do the same,
102

102

00:05:07,170  -->  00:05:09,490
actually with this input field.
103

103

00:05:09,490  -->  00:05:11,610
So an input field as the name says,
104

104

00:05:11,610  -->  00:05:13,940
is where we can input some data.
105

105

00:05:13,940  -->  00:05:17,410
And so actually we can also get the data from here,
106

106

00:05:17,410  -->  00:05:19,523
and we can of course also set it.
107

107

00:05:21,380  -->  00:05:24,000
So lets just see how that works,
108

108

00:05:24,000  -->  00:05:26,180
and it's very similar.
109

109

00:05:26,180  -->  00:05:29,610
So as always, we start by selecting the element.
110

110

00:05:29,610  -->  00:05:31,440
And now we need to get the class name,
111

111

00:05:31,440  -->  00:05:32,943
of this element.
112

112

00:05:35,100  -->  00:05:38,360
And so, that is
113

113

00:05:38,360  -->  00:05:39,690
it's right here.
114

114

00:05:39,690  -->  00:05:42,070
So it has the class of guess,
115

115

00:05:42,070  -->  00:05:44,533
and as I said, it an input element.
116

116

00:05:46,450  -->  00:05:48,490
So, again,
117

117

00:05:48,490  -->  00:05:51,010
dot which is the class selector
118

118

00:05:51,010  -->  00:05:53,670
and then the name of the class which is guess.
119

119

00:05:53,670  -->  00:05:55,430
And here we got this error,
120

120

00:05:55,430  -->  00:05:57,030
because the query selector method
121

121

00:05:57,030  -->  00:05:59,300
expects at least one argument.
122

122

00:05:59,300  -->  00:06:01,668
And as we went to the HTML file,
123

123

00:06:01,668  -->  00:06:04,700
and then saved this JavaScript file,
124

124

00:06:04,700  -->  00:06:06,570
but we didn't have any string here,
125

125

00:06:06,570  -->  00:06:08,550
so any parameter yet.
126

126

00:06:08,550  -->  00:06:10,540
And that's why we got that error.
127

127

00:06:10,540  -->  00:06:13,010
And now if we want to get the value,
128

128

00:06:13,010  -->  00:06:15,130
which right now is actually empty.
129

129

00:06:15,130  -->  00:06:16,850
But if we want to get that,
130

130

00:06:16,850  -->  00:06:20,023
now, this time, we read the value property.
131

131

00:06:20,880  -->  00:06:22,500
And so lets,
132

132

00:06:22,500  -->  00:06:24,890
log that to the console actually.
133

133

00:06:24,890  -->  00:06:27,003
So again using the CL snippet.
134

134

00:06:29,320  -->  00:06:30,783
And if we re-logged this now,
135

135

00:06:31,670  -->  00:06:35,590
yeah, we just get this like empty value here.
136

136

00:06:35,590  -->  00:06:39,700
Because there is really nothing in there, okay.
137

137

00:06:39,700  -->  00:06:42,900
But the big difference is that with an input field,
138

138

00:06:42,900  -->  00:06:44,600
to get the actual value,
139

139

00:06:44,600  -->  00:06:46,853
we use the value property.
140

140

00:06:48,240  -->  00:06:53,240
And we can of course also use it to set a value,
141

141

00:06:53,800  -->  00:06:55,803
so to manipulate this element.
142

142

00:06:59,060  -->  00:07:04,060
So dot value equals 23, give it a save.
143

143

00:07:04,900  -->  00:07:06,810
And now we see 23 here.
144

144

00:07:06,810  -->  00:07:09,840
So as if we had written it ourselves.
145

145

00:07:09,840  -->  00:07:13,620
So we can delete it here just like any input field,
146

146

00:07:13,620  -->  00:07:15,600
but instead of us written the number,
147

147

00:07:15,600  -->  00:07:19,423
it was JavaScript who wrote the 23 here for us.
148

148

00:07:20,530  -->  00:07:23,070
Simply by executing this code here.
149

149

00:07:23,070  -->  00:07:26,063
And to make this line of work actually,
150

150

00:07:30,110  -->  00:07:33,190
and to this line of code here actually work,
151

151

00:07:33,190  -->  00:07:37,250
we can move it below the one where we are setting the value.
152

152

00:07:37,250  -->  00:07:41,710
So in this code lets use alt and the down arrow
153

153

00:07:41,710  -->  00:07:43,480
to move this line down,
154

154

00:07:43,480  -->  00:07:47,010
and then we should expect to see 23 here in the console
155

155

00:07:47,010  -->  00:07:48,743
instead of this empty line.
156

156

00:07:49,770  -->  00:07:50,760
And indeed.
157

157

00:07:50,760  -->  00:07:54,630
Now we first write 23 here to this input field,
158

158

00:07:54,630  -->  00:07:57,180
and then afterwards we read it,
159

159

00:07:57,180  -->  00:08:01,410
and then the value is indeed 23, great.
160

160

00:08:01,410  -->  00:08:05,860
But now what if we actually wanted to get this number here,
161

161

00:08:05,860  -->  00:08:07,770
for example to log it to the console.
162

162

00:08:07,770  -->  00:08:11,070
Whenever we clicked on this button,
163

163

00:08:11,070  -->  00:08:14,240
well, that's taking it to a whole new level,
164

164

00:08:14,240  -->  00:08:16,120
and so handling the click of a button
165

165

00:08:16,120  -->  00:08:19,060
is what we're gonna learn in the next video.
166

166

00:08:19,060  -->  00:08:20,223
See you there soon.
