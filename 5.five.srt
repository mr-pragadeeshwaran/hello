1

00:00:01,510  -->  00:00:03,950
<v ->Let's no continue a building our game</v>
2

2

00:00:03,950  -->  00:00:07,333
and actually implement the game logic itself.
3

3

00:00:09,300  -->  00:00:12,750
And with game logic I basically mean implementing
4

4

00:00:12,750  -->  00:00:15,100
the way how the game works.
5

5

00:00:15,100  -->  00:00:17,110
So we need to implement what happens
6

6

00:00:17,110  -->  00:00:19,210
when the guess is correct.
7

7

00:00:19,210  -->  00:00:21,910
So when it's equal to the secret number,
8

8

00:00:21,910  -->  00:00:23,210
we also need to implement
9

9

00:00:23,210  -->  00:00:25,700
what happens when the guess is too low
10

10

00:00:25,700  -->  00:00:27,330
or when it's too high.
11

11

00:00:27,330  -->  00:00:30,710
So basically we have these three scenarios.
12

12

00:00:30,710  -->  00:00:34,530
And to start we actually need to define that secret number.
13

13

00:00:34,530  -->  00:00:37,650
Otherwise, there is nothing which we can compare
14

14

00:00:37,650  -->  00:00:39,974
the guess to, all right?
15

15

00:00:39,974  -->  00:00:44,560
Now, where do you think we should define that secret number?
16

16

00:00:44,560  -->  00:00:47,750
Should we do it inside of this button handler
17

17

00:00:47,750  -->  00:00:49,263
or should we do it outside?
18

18

00:00:50,270  -->  00:00:53,900
Well, the answer is that we should do it outside
19

19

00:00:53,900  -->  00:00:56,540
because we only want that secret number
20

20

00:00:56,540  -->  00:01:01,190
to be defined once, so only when we start the application.
21

21

00:01:01,190  -->  00:01:04,830
And so that's out here outside of the handler function.
22

22

00:01:04,830  -->  00:01:08,760
If we define the secret number inside this handler function
23

23

00:01:08,760  -->  00:01:12,580
then on each click, we would get a new secret number.
24

24

00:01:12,580  -->  00:01:16,770
And so then the game would make no sense at all, all right?
25

25

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:19,860
We just need one number, which we can then compare
26

26

00:01:19,860  -->  00:01:23,033
to each of the guesses this year on each click.
27

27

00:01:24,860  -->  00:01:28,060
So let's define the number,
28

28

00:01:28,060  -->  00:01:30,380
so I'm just gonna call it number here.
29

29

00:01:30,380  -->  00:01:34,490
And now we need a random number between one and 20.
30

30

00:01:34,490  -->  00:01:37,260
And this is actually pretty similar to the dice roll
31

31

00:01:37,260  -->  00:01:40,223
that we did earlier in a fundamental section.
32

32

00:01:41,120  -->  00:01:44,733
So we use math.random,
33

33

00:01:45,770  -->  00:01:50,680
and so math is basically an object that JavaScript gives us,
34

34

00:01:50,680  -->  00:01:53,380
and on there, we have a lot of different methods,
35

35

00:01:53,380  -->  00:01:55,900
and random is one of them.
36

36

00:01:55,900  -->  00:01:59,683
And it gives us a number between zero and one.
37

37

00:02:00,670  -->  00:02:02,020
So let me show that to you.
38

38

00:02:02,860  -->  00:02:06,230
So whenever I run this, it will give me a new number.
39

39

00:02:06,230  -->  00:02:09,120
And it's always different from the one before.
40

40

00:02:09,120  -->  00:02:12,670
Now if I want a number between one and 20,
41

41

00:02:12,670  -->  00:02:15,830
I will start by multiplying this by 20.
42

42

00:02:15,830  -->  00:02:18,560
And so now we have this decimal number here,
43

43

00:02:18,560  -->  00:02:22,720
basically ranging between zero and 20.
44

44

00:02:22,720  -->  00:02:25,970
But all this decimal here is just noise,
45

45

00:02:25,970  -->  00:02:27,800
so let's removed that.
46

46

00:02:27,800  -->  00:02:31,363
And for that, we use math.trunk.
47

47

00:02:32,220  -->  00:02:34,560
And I'm doing all of this here in the console.
48

48

00:02:34,560  -->  00:02:38,920
So you can see how this is building up, okay?
49

49

00:02:38,920  -->  00:02:43,370
And so now I have a number which goes from zero to 19.
50

50

00:02:43,370  -->  00:02:46,980
Because the result of this here will never really include
51

51

00:02:46,980  -->  00:02:48,560
the number 20.
52

52

00:02:48,560  -->  00:02:52,520
It might only include like 19.999999,
53

53

00:02:52,520  -->  00:02:55,730
but now we're cutting off that decimal part.
54

54

00:02:55,730  -->  00:03:00,140
And so we are now left with a number between zero and 19.
55

55

00:03:00,140  -->  00:03:03,210
And so to elevate it to between one and 20,
56

56

00:03:03,210  -->  00:03:06,440
all you have to do is to add one here.
57

57

00:03:06,440  -->  00:03:08,240
And with this, we make sure that the number
58

58

00:03:08,240  -->  00:03:11,450
is always between these two boundaries.
59

59

00:03:11,450  -->  00:03:13,690
So let's grabbed is now,
60

60

00:03:13,690  -->  00:03:16,510
so now that it works and put it here
61

61

00:03:17,810  -->  00:03:21,220
and with is we have our secret number.
62

62

00:03:21,220  -->  00:03:23,010
Now in the real game
63

63

00:03:23,010  -->  00:03:25,490
the number will obviously be hidden.
64

64

00:03:25,490  -->  00:03:28,190
So behind this question mark,
65

65

00:03:28,190  -->  00:03:30,650
but now since we are still in development,
66

66

00:03:30,650  -->  00:03:32,600
let's actually display the number here
67

67

00:03:32,600  -->  00:03:36,803
so that we can then test our game logic as we develop it.
68

68

00:03:37,720  -->  00:03:39,690
So let's select that number
69

69

00:03:39,690  -->  00:03:42,680
and I think again we already did it before,
70

70

00:03:42,680  -->  00:03:44,653
but let's do it here anyway again.
71

71

00:03:46,767  -->  00:03:49,684
Adjust, so the class name is number
72

72

00:03:52,050  -->  00:03:55,470
and then remember we use text content
73

73

00:03:55,470  -->  00:03:58,930
and to set it, we simply use the equal sign.
74

74

00:03:58,930  -->  00:04:00,573
And now what do we put here?
75

75

00:04:01,750  -->  00:04:05,730
Well, just the number that we just calculated.
76

76

00:04:05,730  -->  00:04:09,390
And now as I save it, watch what happens,
77

77

00:04:09,390  -->  00:04:12,100
here we now have our random number.
78

78

00:04:12,100  -->  00:04:13,620
And as I reload the page
79

79

00:04:13,620  -->  00:04:16,410
you will see different random numbers appearing.
80

80

00:04:16,410  -->  00:04:20,730
And again, for you of course, it will be different numbers.
81

81

00:04:20,730  -->  00:04:23,470
And you see here 20, which is actually the maximum.
82

82

00:04:23,470  -->  00:04:26,600
So this means that 20 is indeed included
83

83

00:04:26,600  -->  00:04:28,763
in our range here.
84

84

00:04:30,520  -->  00:04:33,370
Just to check if it's all right,
85

85

00:04:33,370  -->  00:04:35,730
so if we don't see any weird numbers
86

86

00:04:35,730  -->  00:04:38,090
but it all looks okay to me.
87

87

00:04:38,090  -->  00:04:41,340
And so let's now move on and actually compare
88

88

00:04:41,340  -->  00:04:44,313
the secret number to the users guess.
89

89

00:04:45,980  -->  00:04:48,270
So here we already have the condition,
90

90

00:04:48,270  -->  00:04:50,700
if there is no guess then just print
91

91

00:04:50,700  -->  00:04:53,660
to the message element that there is no number.
92

92

00:04:53,660  -->  00:04:55,590
So that's again, check that,
93

93

00:04:55,590  -->  00:04:57,650
and indeed it works.
94

94

00:04:57,650  -->  00:05:00,650
But now what if there actually is a guess?
95

95

00:05:00,650  -->  00:05:02,493
So let's say Else-if,
96

96

00:05:03,360  -->  00:05:08,360
and now we will actually check if the guess is the same
97

97

00:05:08,690  -->  00:05:11,690
as the secret number.
98

98

00:05:11,690  -->  00:05:13,820
And since I'm always saying secret number,
99

99

00:05:13,820  -->  00:05:16,473
let's actually change the variable name.
100

100

00:05:17,320  -->  00:05:19,470
So double click to select it,
101

101

00:05:19,470  -->  00:05:22,890
and then I can double click on all of the instances
102

102

00:05:22,890  -->  00:05:25,760
so that's this one and this one,
103

103

00:05:25,760  -->  00:05:28,230
so that's a nice vs code trick.
104

104

00:05:28,230  -->  00:05:31,180
And so now I have these three cursors.
105

105

00:05:31,180  -->  00:05:35,107
So let's delete all of that secret number.
106

106

00:05:37,880  -->  00:05:39,600
So the code works the same now
107

107

00:05:39,600  -->  00:05:42,593
but the variable name makes a little bit more sense.
108

108

00:05:43,740  -->  00:05:45,710
So let's create a code block here
109

109

00:05:45,710  -->  00:05:47,660
and now we need to specify what happens
110

110

00:05:47,660  -->  00:05:50,410
when the guess is correct.
111

111

00:05:50,410  -->  00:05:54,620
So again, when the guess is the same as the secret number
112

112

00:05:54,620  -->  00:05:59,053
that's essentially what the guess being means, all right?
113

113

00:06:00,060  -->  00:06:01,320
So what should happen
114

114

00:06:01,320  -->  00:06:05,453
then is that the correct number message should be displayed?
115

115

00:06:06,380  -->  00:06:09,890
So let's copy that and put that here
116

116

00:06:13,530  -->  00:06:15,723
and for now that's actually it.
117

117

00:06:16,890  -->  00:06:18,490
So I'll just give it a safe now,
118

118

00:06:20,180  -->  00:06:22,053
and so let's actually test this.
119

119

00:06:23,230  -->  00:06:26,850
So five, which of course is different,
120

120

00:06:26,850  -->  00:06:30,490
and then in the future we will want a message here saying
121

121

00:06:30,490  -->  00:06:32,620
that the number is too high.
122

122

00:06:32,620  -->  00:06:34,460
So we're gonna do that in a second.
123

123

00:06:34,460  -->  00:06:38,390
But now let's just put the correct number here and indeed
124

124

00:06:38,390  -->  00:06:40,710
we now get correct number.
125

125

00:06:40,710  -->  00:06:43,850
So that's exactly what we defined here
126

126

00:06:43,850  -->  00:06:48,020
in this Else-if block, all right?
127

127

00:06:48,020  -->  00:06:50,530
So I hope all of that makes sense.
128

128

00:06:50,530  -->  00:06:53,560
And now let's work on that scenario that I just mentioned
129

129

00:06:53,560  -->  00:06:56,353
which is when the guess is greater than the number.
130

130

00:06:57,950  -->  00:07:00,160
So you see that here in this big,
131

131

00:07:00,160  -->  00:07:02,570
if else if her statement,
132

132

00:07:02,570  -->  00:07:05,060
we are covering all the different scenarios
133

133

00:07:05,060  -->  00:07:08,570
that might happen here to this number.
134

134

00:07:08,570  -->  00:07:10,640
So the first one was the that there is no number
135

135

00:07:10,640  -->  00:07:12,310
at all, right?
136

136

00:07:12,310  -->  00:07:15,250
Then we checked if it's equal to the secret number,
137

137

00:07:15,250  -->  00:07:17,480
and now we will check if it's greater.
138

138

00:07:17,480  -->  00:07:21,883
So if the guess is greater than the secret number.
139

139

00:07:22,900  -->  00:07:24,283
And then what would happen?
140

140

00:07:25,270  -->  00:07:29,983
Well, let's again select the message .textcontent
141

141

00:07:36,830  -->  00:07:40,340
and then let's say too high.
142

142

00:07:40,340  -->  00:07:42,360
So the guess is too high now
143

143

00:07:42,360  -->  00:07:44,680
and again adding an emoji here.
144

144

00:07:44,680  -->  00:07:46,703
So I want this graph here, okay?
145

145

00:07:53,710  -->  00:07:58,450
And now also, since we are working on this let's account
146

146

00:07:58,450  -->  00:08:02,540
for the last situation or the last scenario as well
147

147

00:08:02,540  -->  00:08:05,723
which is that the guess is lower than a secret number.
148

148

00:08:08,147  -->  00:08:11,200
So guess below secret number,
149

149

00:08:11,200  -->  00:08:14,590
and with this, we covered all the scenarios.
150

150

00:08:14,590  -->  00:08:17,143
Let's just copy this one now, too low,
151

151

00:08:24,940  -->  00:08:28,343
and now we're using the editor graph here,
152

152

00:08:29,550  -->  00:08:31,723
give it a safe and let's test it.
153

153

00:08:32,780  -->  00:08:35,223
So right now we know that it's at three,
154

154

00:08:37,620  -->  00:08:39,200
so let's try at 12.
155

155

00:08:39,200  -->  00:08:44,200
And so now we should see two high, and yes it works.
156

156

00:08:45,270  -->  00:08:49,930
Now let's test one, which is too low and it works again.
157

157

00:08:49,930  -->  00:08:54,300
And now let's test three, which is correct.
158

158

00:08:54,300  -->  00:08:57,170
And indeed it's correct.
159

159

00:08:57,170  -->  00:08:58,850
So that's working already.
160

160

00:08:58,850  -->  00:09:01,090
Now let's move on to the next step
161

161

00:09:01,090  -->  00:09:03,380
which is to work with a score here.
162

162

00:09:03,380  -->  00:09:05,800
So remember that each time that we guess
163

163

00:09:05,800  -->  00:09:09,520
a wrong number our score showed to decrease.
164

164

00:09:09,520  -->  00:09:11,543
So let me show that to you again.
165

165

00:09:13,160  -->  00:09:16,450
So let's say five and see how it starts at 20,
166

166

00:09:16,450  -->  00:09:19,770
just like in our code, but now as I check wrong
167

167

00:09:20,720  -->  00:09:23,883
so it's too high and now the score decreased to 19.
168

168

00:09:24,800  -->  00:09:26,910
So let me check another one.
169

169

00:09:26,910  -->  00:09:29,880
And so now you see that my number goes down each time
170

170

00:09:29,880  -->  00:09:32,470
that I do a wrong guess.
171

171

00:09:32,470  -->  00:09:35,663
And so let's implement that in our code here as well.
172

172

00:09:37,030  -->  00:09:41,360
So as you see here, we start with a score of 20.
173

173

00:09:41,360  -->  00:09:46,270
And now in these two scenarios where the guess is wrong,
174

174

00:09:46,270  -->  00:09:49,470
so here where it's above and here where it's below.
175

175

00:09:49,470  -->  00:09:53,430
We want to decrease that score by a one, all right?
176

176

00:09:53,430  -->  00:09:56,430
Because again, each time that there is a wrong guess
177

177

00:09:56,430  -->  00:09:58,950
the score should decrease by one.
178

178

00:09:58,950  -->  00:10:01,210
So how should we do that?
179

179

00:10:01,210  -->  00:10:04,580
And I can think of two ways of doing that.
180

180

00:10:04,580  -->  00:10:08,190
The first way is to read the score from here,
181

181

00:10:08,190  -->  00:10:11,830
then decrease it by one and then print it here again.
182

182

00:10:11,830  -->  00:10:14,280
So that would be the first way of doing it,
183

183

00:10:14,280  -->  00:10:16,030
but there is a better way.
184

184

00:10:16,030  -->  00:10:18,870
And the better way is to actually create a variable
185

185

00:10:18,870  -->  00:10:22,930
for the score in the code and then update that variable
186

186

00:10:22,930  -->  00:10:25,460
so basically to decrease that variable
187

187

00:10:25,460  -->  00:10:27,140
and then display the value
188

188

00:10:27,140  -->  00:10:31,000
of that variable here in this score label.
189

189

00:10:31,000  -->  00:10:34,400
And by doing that, we have our data also in the code
190

190

00:10:34,400  -->  00:10:36,700
and not just on the DOM.
191

191

00:10:36,700  -->  00:10:39,163
And so that's always a very good thing to do.
192

192

00:10:40,420  -->  00:10:42,430
So let me do that now and then I will explain
193

193

00:10:42,430  -->  00:10:43,580
it a little bit better.
194

194

00:10:45,360  -->  00:10:49,220
So I'm gonna do that right here after the secret number,
195

195

00:10:49,220  -->  00:10:54,220
so const score, and as you already know we start with 20.
196

196

00:10:56,750  -->  00:10:58,830
And so that's our initial score.
197

197

00:10:58,830  -->  00:11:01,920
So the value that we set to this variable.
198

198

00:11:01,920  -->  00:11:03,620
And actually this should be a let,
199

199

00:11:04,510  -->  00:11:07,810
because we will then decrease that value, remember.
200

200

00:11:07,810  -->  00:11:10,060
And so it cannot be a const
201

201

00:11:10,060  -->  00:11:12,510
because a constant is immutable.
202

202

00:11:12,510  -->  00:11:13,650
Now, okay?
203

203

00:11:13,650  -->  00:11:15,580
And now here let's go back
204

204

00:11:15,580  -->  00:11:18,010
to the wrong guess scenario.
205

205

00:11:18,010  -->  00:11:21,350
Our scenario was, because it's this one and this one
206

206

00:11:21,350  -->  00:11:24,223
and then all we do is to decrease the score.
207

207

00:11:25,170  -->  00:11:30,170
So score equal score minus one.
208

208

00:11:30,900  -->  00:11:34,510
And maybe you already know, or hopefully you do,
209

209

00:11:34,510  -->  00:11:36,400
that this is the same as writing,
210

210

00:11:36,400  -->  00:11:40,970
score minus minus, all right?
211

211

00:11:40,970  -->  00:11:42,890
So we decreased the score
212

212

00:11:42,890  -->  00:11:45,170
and then all we have to do is to display
213

213

00:11:45,170  -->  00:11:47,863
that score here in this element.
214

214

00:11:48,751  -->  00:11:51,570
So once again, we already did that.
215

215

00:11:51,570  -->  00:11:53,423
So no need to repeat.
216

216

00:11:54,590  -->  00:11:56,103
So it's this one here.
217

217

00:12:00,070  -->  00:12:03,430
So we select the element with the class of score
218

218

00:12:03,430  -->  00:12:08,430
and then at the text content we give the score, all right?
219

219

00:12:09,890  -->  00:12:11,150
And that's it.
220

220

00:12:11,150  -->  00:12:13,280
Now we just need the same code
221

221

00:12:13,280  -->  00:12:16,180
also in the other wrong scenario.
222

222

00:12:16,180  -->  00:12:18,890
So where the guess is below the secret number.
223

223

00:12:18,890  -->  00:12:22,973
So I'm just copying this code and putting it here,
224

224

00:12:24,210  -->  00:12:27,400
give it a safe and a before testing it
225

225

00:12:27,400  -->  00:12:30,410
let me again, explain what we just did here.
226

226

00:12:30,410  -->  00:12:32,980
So as I said, we could have also stored
227

227

00:12:32,980  -->  00:12:35,760
this score basically in the DOM.
228

228

00:12:35,760  -->  00:12:38,150
And to do that we would always just read
229

229

00:12:38,150  -->  00:12:39,740
this value from here.
230

230

00:12:39,740  -->  00:12:43,760
So right from the DOM , then we could decrease that value
231

231

00:12:43,760  -->  00:12:46,330
and then write it back here to the DOM
232

232

00:12:46,330  -->  00:12:49,880
but then we would not have that value in our code.
233

233

00:12:49,880  -->  00:12:52,540
So essentially our application would have no way
234

234

00:12:52,540  -->  00:12:55,400
of knowing that score at all points.
235

235

00:12:55,400  -->  00:12:59,260
And so it's always good to keep a variable
236

236

00:12:59,260  -->  00:13:02,370
which actually holds the data in our code
237

237

00:13:02,370  -->  00:13:06,620
and not just rely on the DOM to hold our data, all right?
238

238

00:13:06,620  -->  00:13:10,680
And this variable here can also be called a state variable.
239

239

00:13:10,680  -->  00:13:12,930
Because this score is part
240

240

00:13:12,930  -->  00:13:15,770
of the so-called application state
241

241

00:13:15,770  -->  00:13:18,940
which is basically all the data that is relevant
242

242

00:13:18,940  -->  00:13:20,450
to the application.
243

243

00:13:20,450  -->  00:13:22,170
And we could say that 17,
244

244

00:13:22,170  -->  00:13:24,870
so the secret number is also part
245

245

00:13:24,870  -->  00:13:28,850
of the state of our application, all right?
246

246

00:13:28,850  -->  00:13:32,300
And so we want all the data always to be available
247

247

00:13:32,300  -->  00:13:36,727
somewhere in our code and not just in the DOM , okay?
248

248

00:13:36,727  -->  00:13:38,980
But always keep that in mind,
249

249

00:13:38,980  -->  00:13:42,700
and so that is why we implemented a solution like this.
250

250

00:13:42,700  -->  00:13:44,530
So whenever there's a wrong guess,
251

251

00:13:44,530  -->  00:13:47,960
we just take the score that we already have in our code,
252

252

00:13:47,960  -->  00:13:49,810
then we decrease it by one
253

253

00:13:49,810  -->  00:13:52,943
and then we display that new score right here.
254

254

00:13:54,780  -->  00:13:59,400
So let's reload, let's say 17.
255

255

00:13:59,400  -->  00:14:01,573
And watch what happens to our score now.
256

256

00:14:03,470  -->  00:14:08,010
And indeed it decreased to 19 and our number is too high.
257

257

00:14:08,010  -->  00:14:09,930
And when I click again now,
258

258

00:14:09,930  -->  00:14:11,823
you see it decreasing even more.
259

259

00:14:12,770  -->  00:14:15,343
Now let's try with a lower number.
260

260

00:14:16,360  -->  00:14:20,180
So too low and our score decreased again.
261

261

00:14:20,180  -->  00:14:22,370
And actually let's keep going,
262

262

00:14:22,370  -->  00:14:26,880
so let's keep clicking here and watch what happens.
263

263

00:14:26,880  -->  00:14:30,260
So I'm clicking over and over on the same button here
264

264

00:14:30,260  -->  00:14:35,260
and the score keeps going down and eventually we reach zero.
265

265

00:14:35,763  -->  00:14:37,190
And at this point
266

266

00:14:37,190  -->  00:14:40,370
we should basically lose the game, all right?
267

267

00:14:40,370  -->  00:14:43,060
But as you see here, nothing of course happens.
268

268

00:14:43,060  -->  00:14:46,480
And we can keep clicking here and go until affinity
269

269

00:14:46,480  -->  00:14:49,060
and our program we'll of course not care.
270

270

00:14:49,060  -->  00:14:52,740
Because our program obviously has no idea of losing
271

271

00:14:52,740  -->  00:14:55,237
or of winning the game, all right?
272

272

00:14:55,237  -->  00:14:59,600
It is completely on us to write all that logic.
273

273

00:14:59,600  -->  00:15:01,560
So basically what this means
274

274

00:15:01,560  -->  00:15:03,830
is that all of this checking here,
275

275

00:15:03,830  -->  00:15:07,560
so doing all this here should only happen whenever the score
276

276

00:15:07,560  -->  00:15:09,580
is still above zero.
277

277

00:15:09,580  -->  00:15:12,250
And then when the score is actually zero,
278

278

00:15:12,250  -->  00:15:15,351
then we should get some kind of message here saying
279

279

00:15:15,351  -->  00:15:17,830
that we lost the game.
280

280

00:15:17,830  -->  00:15:21,543
So let's quickly do that here, inside of this scenario.
281

281

00:15:23,200  -->  00:15:26,860
So basically we need another if statement here inside
282

282

00:15:26,860  -->  00:15:30,190
this already Else-if block.
283

283

00:15:30,190  -->  00:15:32,260
And that's of course not a problem at all.
284

284

00:15:32,260  -->  00:15:36,230
We can perfectly have one if inside of the other.
285

285

00:15:36,230  -->  00:15:39,840
So what I was just saying is that this here,
286

286

00:15:39,840  -->  00:15:42,940
all of this should basically only happen
287

287

00:15:42,940  -->  00:15:46,110
while the score is still above zero.
288

288

00:15:46,110  -->  00:15:48,140
So let's do that.
289

289

00:15:48,140  -->  00:15:51,810
So if score is above zero
290

290

00:15:54,320  -->  00:15:58,030
only then do all of this, all right.
291

291

00:16:00,870  -->  00:16:05,870
And now Else, so basically if it is zero,
292

292

00:16:06,930  -->  00:16:09,383
then we want to display another message.
293

293

00:16:11,560  -->  00:16:16,560
So we want to say you lost the game with some losing emoji.
294

294

00:16:24,870  -->  00:16:26,990
So I'm gonna use this one here,
295

295

00:16:26,990  -->  00:16:28,813
so that's an explosion I believe.
296

296

00:16:33,130  -->  00:16:35,490
So let's test that now.
297

297

00:16:35,490  -->  00:16:39,280
And we only implement this for when the guess
298

298

00:16:39,280  -->  00:16:41,283
is above the secret number.
299

299

00:16:42,250  -->  00:16:45,670
So let's now use 12, it's too high
300

300

00:16:45,670  -->  00:16:48,473
and now let's keep going to test what happens.
301

301

00:16:49,860  -->  00:16:51,580
So we are approaching it now
302

302

00:16:53,230  -->  00:16:54,960
and now we lost the game.
303

303

00:16:54,960  -->  00:16:57,120
But actually I could click twice
304

304

00:16:57,120  -->  00:16:59,660
as my score was already zero.
305

305

00:16:59,660  -->  00:17:03,070
So try this for yourself, I will just reload here,
306

306

00:17:03,070  -->  00:17:05,873
and again put a number that is above.
307

307

00:17:12,847  -->  00:17:14,850
So now the score is one and as I click,
308

308

00:17:14,850  -->  00:17:17,770
we should get a message you lost the game.
309

309

00:17:17,770  -->  00:17:21,410
So let's try and it didn't happen yet.
310

310

00:17:21,410  -->  00:17:23,840
And it did not happen because the score
311

311

00:17:23,840  -->  00:17:27,970
was indeed still a greater than zero here, all right?
312

312

00:17:27,970  -->  00:17:32,163
So we need to change that to greater than one, okay?
313

313

00:17:38,040  -->  00:17:39,953
So again, a larger number.
314

314

00:17:43,680  -->  00:17:48,680
Now I get one and if I click now you lost the game.
315

315

00:17:49,310  -->  00:17:52,993
And all we need to do is to update the score to zero here.
316

316

00:17:55,310  -->  00:18:00,310
So let's just copy this, write zero,
317

317

00:18:01,730  -->  00:18:04,670
and then before we test it we can actually copy
318

318

00:18:04,670  -->  00:18:08,310
the same code to this other scenario.
319

319

00:18:08,310  -->  00:18:11,850
Now, as you can see, we are creating a lot of duplicate code
320

320

00:18:11,850  -->  00:18:14,583
and we will fix that by the end of this project.
321

321

00:18:15,420  -->  00:18:18,003
But for now, let's just keep working on this.
322

322

00:18:20,400  -->  00:18:23,793
And the only thing that really changes here is this message.
323

323

00:18:26,860  -->  00:18:29,600
So you'll see that here is some potential
324

324

00:18:29,600  -->  00:18:31,493
to eliminate duplicate code.
325

325

00:18:32,600  -->  00:18:35,180
But again we will take care of later off that,
326

326

00:18:35,180  -->  00:18:39,410
for now let's just make it work, okay?
327

327

00:18:39,410  -->  00:18:41,740
And with this I think we're actually finished.
328

328

00:18:41,740  -->  00:18:43,113
Let's just test it.
329

329

00:18:44,560  -->  00:18:47,513
So five is too low,
330

330

00:18:49,260  -->  00:18:54,260
so let's keep going down and you lost a game, great.
331

331

00:18:55,740  -->  00:18:59,750
Now let's test a larger number
332

332

00:18:59,750  -->  00:19:04,750
and I keep clicking here and now we lost the game too.
333

333

00:19:06,940  -->  00:19:10,640
Great, so our game logic is already working
334

334

00:19:10,640  -->  00:19:12,250
and actually the game itself
335

335

00:19:12,250  -->  00:19:14,760
is also kind of working already.
336

336

00:19:14,760  -->  00:19:17,330
There's just two things that are missing here
337

337

00:19:17,330  -->  00:19:21,530
which is the high score and this play again button.
338

338

00:19:21,530  -->  00:19:24,060
But before implementing that functionality,
339

339

00:19:24,060  -->  00:19:25,640
in the next video we're gonna talk
340

340

00:19:25,640  -->  00:19:27,980
a little bit about CSS
341

341

00:19:27,980  -->  00:19:31,313
and how we can manipulate styles using JavaScript.
