1

00:00:01,100  -->  00:00:03,630
<v tutor>All right.So let's now implement</v>
2

2

00:00:03,630  -->  00:00:06,620
the last missing functionality in our game,
3

3

00:00:06,620  -->  00:00:08,463
which is the high scores.
4

4

00:00:09,880  -->  00:00:12,550
And to really understand how the high score
5

5

00:00:12,550  -->  00:00:14,280
should work in this game,
6

6

00:00:14,280  -->  00:00:17,283
let's take a look at the demo again.
7

7

00:00:18,420  -->  00:00:20,880
So let's reload the game.
8

8

00:00:20,880  -->  00:00:21,993
And let's start here.
9

9

00:00:23,770  -->  00:00:26,983
And so you see that the score starts at 19.
10

10

00:00:29,610  -->  00:00:33,733
So let's try a couple of times to a low score.
11

11

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:40,950
Okay, so correct number two score is 10.
12

12

00:00:40,950  -->  00:00:44,370
And the high score is now also set to 10.
13

13

00:00:44,370  -->  00:00:46,330
Because this was my first game,
14

14

00:00:46,330  -->  00:00:49,810
and so now this is also my new high score.
15

15

00:00:49,810  -->  00:00:51,423
But now as I play again,
16

16

00:00:52,390  -->  00:00:55,560
my score is of course, resetted to 20.
17

17

00:00:55,560  -->  00:00:59,400
But now, if I do a better score, than this 10 here,
18

18

00:00:59,400  -->  00:01:01,813
then that will become my new high score.
19

19

00:01:02,760  -->  00:01:07,300
Okay, and that is going to happen as soon as I win the game.
20

20

00:01:07,300  -->  00:01:08,563
So let's play again.
21

21

00:01:13,350  -->  00:01:15,893
And to wish for a quick result.
22

22

00:01:18,320  -->  00:01:22,270
And great, so now my score is 17.
23

23

00:01:22,270  -->  00:01:25,660
And since that is more than the 10, that I had before,
24

24

00:01:25,660  -->  00:01:28,060
that is now also my highest score.
25

25

00:01:28,060  -->  00:01:31,690
Okay. Again because the current score is larger
26

26

00:01:31,690  -->  00:01:33,540
than the previous high score.
27

27

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:35,970
And so that is now the new high score.
28

28

00:01:35,970  -->  00:01:38,670
Okay. Now, right. And so basically,
29

29

00:01:38,670  -->  00:01:42,653
what we just store here is now what we need to implement.
30

30

00:01:43,840  -->  00:01:45,580
First off, we're gonna to need a
31

31

00:01:45,580  -->  00:01:48,440
variable for the high score.
32

32

00:01:48,440  -->  00:01:51,960
Right. So just like for the regular score,
33

33

00:01:51,960  -->  00:01:55,223
we also need to store the high score in a variable.
34

34

00:01:56,600  -->  00:01:59,110
So let, high score
35

35

00:02:00,150  -->  00:02:03,010
and let's start this one at zero.
36

36

00:02:03,010  -->  00:02:05,720
This way, the first score is always gonna be
37

37

00:02:05,720  -->  00:02:06,780
the highest score,
38

38

00:02:06,780  -->  00:02:09,803
because it's always going to be greater than zero.
39

39

00:02:11,570  -->  00:02:15,590
Okay.So where do you think we should check
40

40

00:02:15,590  -->  00:02:17,270
for the high score?.
41

41

00:02:17,270  -->  00:02:19,560
So basically, if the current score
42

42

00:02:19,560  -->  00:02:21,940
is greater than the high score?.
43

43

00:02:21,940  -->  00:02:25,240
Well, remember that here the high score was set
44

44

00:02:25,240  -->  00:02:27,780
as soon as the player won the game.
45

45

00:02:27,780  -->  00:02:29,633
And so where is that in our code?
46

46

00:02:30,640  -->  00:02:33,223
Well, it's here in this if block.
47

47

00:02:34,420  -->  00:02:37,233
Okay, and so this is where we will check.
48

48

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:39,860
And to check that we will do,
49

49

00:02:39,860  -->  00:02:41,780
as I explained previously,
50

50

00:02:41,780  -->  00:02:46,777
is to ask whether the score is greater
51

51

00:02:48,430  -->  00:02:50,203
than the current high score.
52

52

00:02:51,290  -->  00:02:53,510
Right. And if it is,
53

53

00:02:53,510  -->  00:02:57,200
so if our score of the current game is greater
54

54

00:02:57,200  -->  00:02:59,380
than the highest score that we already had,
55

55

00:02:59,380  -->  00:03:01,670
well, then the highest score will become
56

56

00:03:01,670  -->  00:03:03,203
this new current score.
57

57

00:03:04,050  -->  00:03:08,673
Right. So high score,equal score.
58

58

00:03:10,450  -->  00:03:11,710
And that's it.
59

59

00:03:11,710  -->  00:03:13,890
Now all we have to do is to display
60

60

00:03:13,890  -->  00:03:18,460
that new high score here, in this element.
61

61

00:03:18,460  -->  00:03:21,990
And actually, of course in our version of the game.
62

62

00:03:21,990  -->  00:03:23,053
So right here.
63

63

00:03:24,250  -->  00:03:26,873
So let's check the class name.
64

64

00:03:27,720  -->  00:03:31,810
And it is called the highest score here.
65

65

00:03:31,810  -->  00:03:33,773
So just this span,
66

66

00:03:35,290  -->  00:03:40,290
So, document dot query selector.
67

67

00:03:42,040  -->  00:03:45,100
And do remember, you should always write all of this here
68

68

00:03:45,100  -->  00:03:48,720
by hand, to really put it into your brain.
69

69

00:03:48,720  -->  00:03:53,720
So document dot query selector and dot high score.
70

70

00:03:55,920  -->  00:03:58,283
And I have a problem writing score, apparently.
71

71

00:03:59,130  -->  00:04:04,130
So text content, and this will be set to high score.
72

72

00:04:06,164  -->  00:04:08,430
Okay, that's it.
73

73

00:04:08,430  -->  00:04:10,890
This is the translation of the logic
74

74

00:04:10,890  -->  00:04:13,130
that I just explained earlier.
75

75

00:04:13,130  -->  00:04:15,330
So we need to have a high score variable,
76

76

00:04:15,330  -->  00:04:17,380
so that we can keep track of it.
77

77

00:04:17,380  -->  00:04:19,600
And then whenever our game finishes,
78

78

00:04:19,600  -->  00:04:21,840
we check if the current score is
79

79

00:04:21,840  -->  00:04:23,540
greater than the high score.
80

80

00:04:23,540  -->  00:04:26,950
And if it is, that will become the new high score.
81

81

00:04:26,950  -->  00:04:29,130
And so we set or high score variable
82

82

00:04:29,130  -->  00:04:31,243
to the current score here.
83

83

00:04:32,790  -->  00:04:33,653
Okay.
84

84

00:04:35,020  -->  00:04:38,330
That's just to make sure we load it here.
85

85

00:04:38,330  -->  00:04:42,070
And then let's play too high,Correct.
86

86

00:04:44,020  -->  00:04:46,180
Oh now we have a very high score,
87

87

00:04:46,180  -->  00:04:48,680
because we did it in our second guess.
88

88

00:04:48,680  -->  00:04:51,040
Let me actually reload this page here.
89

89

00:04:51,040  -->  00:04:54,500
So I want a really low, high score.
90

90

00:04:54,500  -->  00:04:55,823
So let's try it again.
91

91

00:04:57,550  -->  00:05:01,203
So I click a couple of times to decrease the current score.
92

92

00:05:03,780  -->  00:05:06,930
Oh, and now we have a score of 14.
93

93

00:05:06,930  -->  00:05:09,660
And you see the new high score is now 14.
94

94

00:05:09,660  -->  00:05:11,340
Because it used to be zero,
95

95

00:05:11,340  -->  00:05:13,330
but of course, 14 is greater.
96

96

00:05:13,330  -->  00:05:16,023
And so 14 becomes our new high score.
97

97

00:05:17,990  -->  00:05:20,450
Okay, and now as I click again,
98

98

00:05:20,450  -->  00:05:24,520
everything will reset, except for the high score.
99

99

00:05:24,520  -->  00:05:27,200
So that was the goal of having this button here.
100

100

00:05:27,200  -->  00:05:29,070
So that we can play the game again,
101

101

00:05:29,070  -->  00:05:30,750
but keeping the high score.
102

102

00:05:30,750  -->  00:05:33,500
Because of course, if we reload the whole page,
103

103

00:05:33,500  -->  00:05:35,310
then everything will be lost.
104

104

00:05:35,310  -->  00:05:37,540
So the whole code will then run again,
105

105

00:05:37,540  -->  00:05:40,070
and everything will reset.
106

106

00:05:40,070  -->  00:05:43,203
But here, we now keep our high score, right.
107

107

00:05:44,380  -->  00:05:48,690
So let's play again, and try to get a,
108

108

00:05:48,690  -->  00:05:50,600
a better score here.
109

109

00:05:50,600  -->  00:05:51,973
So that's too low,
110

110

00:05:56,900  -->  00:06:01,180
17, maybe, and, yeah, now we get an even better score,
111

111

00:06:01,180  -->  00:06:05,143
because of course, 18 is even greater than 17.
112

112

00:06:06,150  -->  00:06:10,460
One last time now with a lower score,
113

113

00:06:10,460  -->  00:06:14,960
just to see that it will then not become the new high score.
114

114

00:06:14,960  -->  00:06:17,760
So we always need to test for all the scenarios
115

115

00:06:17,760  -->  00:06:19,440
that we implemented in the code.
116

116

00:06:19,440  -->  00:06:21,863
Just to make sure that everything works.
117

117

00:06:23,170  -->  00:06:27,280
All 15 again, and so you see that the score was now 12.
118

118

00:06:27,280  -->  00:06:30,990
But the highest score, of course, remained at 18.
119

119

00:06:30,990  -->  00:06:34,923
Because this part here is now not true. Right?
120

120

00:06:36,400  -->  00:06:40,080
Okay, so we implemented that as well.
121

121

00:06:40,080  -->  00:06:43,990
And now our game is actually functional, it works just fine.
122

122

00:06:43,990  -->  00:06:46,550
And you can show this now to a friend
123

123

00:06:46,550  -->  00:06:49,690
and tell them that you built this on your own
124

124

00:06:49,690  -->  00:06:51,910
with the power of JavaScript.
125

125

00:06:51,910  -->  00:06:54,070
So how great is that?
126

126

00:06:54,070  -->  00:06:58,200
So again, congratulations for making it to this point,
127

127

00:06:58,200  -->  00:07:02,400
and for building really your first game using code.
128

128

00:07:02,400  -->  00:07:05,100
Now, it's not really a sophisticated game,
129

129

00:07:05,100  -->  00:07:08,510
but I still think it's a great achievement.
130

130

00:07:08,510  -->  00:07:09,820
Now in the next video,
131

131

00:07:09,820  -->  00:07:13,583
we will finish up and clean this code a little bit.
132

132

00:07:14,567  -->  00:07:19,567
For example, this code here that we have in this scenario,
133

133

00:07:19,690  -->  00:07:21,200
where the guess is too high,
134

134

00:07:21,200  -->  00:07:25,080
is almost the same as we have here.
135

135

00:07:25,080  -->  00:07:27,290
And so we can change that a little bit
136

136

00:07:27,290  -->  00:07:29,680
to eliminate some of this duplicate codes.
137

137

00:07:29,680  -->  00:07:33,130
There's also some other duplicate code
138

138

00:07:33,130  -->  00:07:35,090
that we can get rid of.
139

139

00:07:35,090  -->  00:07:39,000
And so yeah, let's do that in the next lecture,
140

140

00:07:39,000  -->  00:07:42,020
because it's also important to really finish up
141

141

00:07:42,020  -->  00:07:45,023
all applications and not just make them work.
